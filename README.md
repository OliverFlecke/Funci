# Compiler for a still unnamed functional language 

This project is focus on building a functional language. So far, I'm only starting on the lexer and parser, which will first be build by hand, and afterwards by some of the inbuild parser libraries in Haskell. 

## Testing of the compiler 
So far, all testing of the lexer is done through the LexerTest.hs, which runs different strings through the lexer, and checks that it provides the correct result.

This should be updated to have automatic test.
